# Micro Scraper

## Setup

1.  Install dependencies:

        npm install

2.  Install Playwright browsers:

        npx playwright install

3.  Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

        PORT=3001

4.  Start the development server:

        npm run dev

The server runs on the port defined in your `.env` file (defaults to
**3001** if not provided).

## Notes

-   Ensure Playwright browsers are installed before running scrapers.
-   Update environment variables in `.env` as needed.
